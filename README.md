# synscancontrol

This project is an open source recreation of the motherboard of the popular HEQ-5 (Orion Sirius EQ-G) mount using the SynScan protocol.

## Features

:warning: I did not implement the autoguider port interface, since PHD2 doesn't use this.
  - The PCB can handle this port though, so only the code needs to be written.

## Motivation

My original motherboard broke and the (really expensive) replacement I purchased had a problem with the motor driver. So I designed my own instead to never have this problem again.

## Instructions

### OTA Updates

### UDP Logging
